      <h2>The Ultimate Engine Swap</h2>
	  
	  <br>
	  
      <p>
        Just when things couldn't get any cooler,
        HGK Racing are one of the first group of people to swap a 2jz into an A90,
        which is pushing out 1,000 horsepower which is truly insane,
        this bad boy is fully set for pro level drifting with a whole new suspension set underneath,
        you have to admire the workmanship of doing such an intense engine swap into this new A90.

      <h2>The Future Of JDM Car's</h2>
	  
	  <br>
	  
      <p>
      It seems we might be getting some new car's this year,
      there is some information out at the moment regarding the future and current plans,
      for Nissan, Toyota, Subaru and Mazda its quite unclear whether they will all go ahead of plan,
      but what we do know is that we will be getting a new Gtr from Nissan as well as a new Zx known as a 400zx,
      we will be also getting a new Subaru Wrx and a new 86 from Toyota and Subaru.
      Mazda has teased a little with a snippet of a new Rx series in the works carrying a new rotary engine,
      there is fair bit of information that we have recieved but there is still some that is unclear.
